# OSAKI Project

## Overview
The OSAKI Project is an open-source initiative aimed at creating an affordable, fuel-efficient kit car. Our goal is to design a vehicle that costs under $10,000 to build and delivers 80 mpg. By leveraging community contributions and innovative engineering, we're developing a customizable, eco-friendly two-seater that enthusiasts can assemble themselves.
